# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Stack

Django 5.1 + Django REST Framework backend for "Marky", a multi-tenant platform where each business (commercial or entrepreneur) manages a profile, branches, products, and promotions. Primary language of the domain/UI strings is Spanish; `LANGUAGE_CODE = 'es'`, timezone `America/Asuncion`.

## Commands

The virtualenv lives in `env/`. Activate it first: `source env/bin/activate`.

```bash
python manage.py runserver              # dev server (port from env or 8000)
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py test                   # run all tests
python manage.py test products          # single app
python manage.py test products.tests.SomeTest.test_method   # single test
python manage.py cities_light           # download/import city & country data (PY, VE)
python manage.py send_queued_mail       # flush the post_office email queue
```

Note: test files are currently stubs — there is no real test suite yet.

## Environment & database

- Config is read from `.env` via `django-environ` (see `.env.example`).
- **No `DATABASE_URL` set → SQLite** (`db.sqlite3`). When `DATABASE_URL` is set, the engine is forced to **PostGIS** (`django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis`), not plain Postgres. GIS features (the `Branch.location` PointField, distance queries) only work against PostGIS — see `README.md` for the `apt-get install binutils gdal-bin libgdal-dev` + `CREATE EXTENSION postgis` setup.
- `marky_backend/local_settings.py` is imported last if present and overrides everything (gitignored, currently empty).

## Architecture

Three Django apps, all routed under `/api/v1/` (see `marky_backend/urls.py`):

- **`users`** — custom `AUTH_USER_MODEL = users.User` (extends `AbstractUser`, adds `business_name`, `phone_number`, `is_verified`). Handles the full auth flow: register, email verification, login, JWT refresh, password recovery/change. Auth endpoints under `/api/v1/users/`.
- **`business`** — the tenant model. `BusinessProfile` (OneToOne with `User`), `Branch` (with PostGIS `PointField`), `Currency`, `SocialMediaLink`, plus aggregate endpoints (`home-page/`, `account-info/`). Under `/api/v1/business/`.
- **`products`** — `ProductCategory`, `Product`, `ProductVariant`, `ProductAddon`, `ProductMedia`, all owned by a `BusinessProfile`. Under `/api/v1/products/`.

**Top-level directories that are NOT Django apps:** `business_profiles/` and `product_variants/` are media/upload targets; `cities/` is the `CITIES_LIGHT_DATA_DIR` (downloaded geonames data); `media/` is `MEDIA_ROOT`; `utils/` holds shared helpers (no app config). Only `users`, `business`, `products` are in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

### Tenancy & queryset scoping

Every business-scoped view filters its queryset by the requesting user's profile, e.g. `Product.objects.filter(business=user.business_profile)`, and returns `.none()` for users without a `business_profile`. When adding endpoints that touch business data, **always scope through `request.user.business_profile`** — there is no row-level DB enforcement. `User.has_configuration` / `hasattr(user, 'business_profile')` is the standard "is this user set up" check.

### Auth & permissions

- JWT via `djangorestframework-simplejwt` (`Authorization: Bearer ...`). Both Session and JWT auth are enabled.
- Email verification uses a 6-digit code **embedded as a claim inside a short-lived JWT** (not stored in the DB) — see `users/views.py` `RegisterView`/`VerifyEmailView`. Emails are sent through `post_office` (DB-queued; flush with `send_queued_mail`).
- `utils/permissions.py::IsBusinessOrSuperAdmin` gates business/product endpoints — it checks membership in the Django **group named `business`** (users are auto-added to this group on register) or `is_superuser`.

### Multi-currency pricing

`BusinessProfile` carries `primary_currency`, optional `secondary_currency`, `exchange_rate`, and `is_primary_to_secondary` (direction flag). `Product`, `ProductVariant`, and `ProductAddon` each implement `get_primary_secondary_amounts()` which returns `(primary, secondary, primary_currency, secondary_currency)` as Decimals. Reuse this method rather than re-deriving conversions; keep arithmetic in `Decimal`.

### Promotions

Both `ProductCategory` and `Product` carry the same promotion fields (`multibuy_option` 2x1/3x2, `discount_percentage`, `promotion_starts_at/ends_at`). `products/filters.py::ProductCategoryFilter.filter_has_promotion` defines what "active promotion" means (date-window + Exists subquery over child products) — match that logic when querying promotions elsewhere.

### File uploads / nested forms

DRF is configured globally with `drf_nested_forms` parsers (`NestedMultiPartParser`, `NestedJSONParser`) before the standard `FormParser`. This lets multipart requests carry nested structures (e.g. a product plus its variants/media/addons and their image files in one request). Product write views use `ProductInputSerializer` for create/update and `ProductSerializer` for reads (`get_serializer_class` switches by action). Image uploads are validated by `business/validators.py` (≤2MB, jpg/jpeg/png/gif).

## API docs

Spectacular schema at `/api/schema/`, Swagger UI at `/api/schema/swagger/`, ReDoc at `/api/schema/redoc/`. Tag new endpoints with `@extend_schema(tags=[...])` using the existing tags (`Auth`, `Business`, `Cities`, `Products`).
